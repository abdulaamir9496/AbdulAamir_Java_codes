        //Nowadays, compiler and IDE are way smarter to assist us while writing code error free
        //Sometimes it could be compiled time error, or sometimes it could be runtime error.
        //Syntax error will never go to a client. We give exe.file to the client.

        //Class file will not be generated when there are errors.
        //No need to worry much about syntactical error.
